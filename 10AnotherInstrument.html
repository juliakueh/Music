                <span>String Instrument</span>
                <p>The double bass, also known as the string bass or bass,
                    is the biggest and deepest-pitched among all the string instruments, sounding an octave below the cello.
                    Given its height, taller than the musician, 
                    the bassist either stands or sits on a high stool to perform, with the instrument resting on the floor

                <span>String Instrument</span>
                <p>The cello produces notes just one octave lower than the viola, despite being much larger in size.
                    Because of its size, the cello has an end pin that rests on the ground to support the weight of the instrument. 
                    To play, the cellist must sit on a chair with the cello resting between his or her knees

                <span>String Instrument</span>
                <p>A string insrtument that looks slightly larger than violin which played in the same manner is called a viola.
                    The viola has a warmer tone than the violin because it shares the same three lower strings, 
                    but its fourth string is tuned a fifth lower than the violin's lowest string and is often used to provide harmonies that complement the violin's melody

                <p>The violin, the smallest and highest-pitched string instrument, is typically held beneath the chin and positioned on the player's left shoulder for proper playing posture. 
                    It can be played while standing or sitting.Typically, violinists in an ensemble sit whereas soloists stand

                <p>The trumpet is known for its bright and clear tone quality, achieved as air flows through about six and a half feet of coiled tubing. 
                    In the early 19th century, three valves were introduced to alter pitches in the contemporary trumpet
