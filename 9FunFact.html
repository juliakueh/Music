                <p>The Costliest Piano is valued at $3,400,000.
                    “As Time Goes By" piano is the same piano that Dooley Wilson's character, Sam, was performing on in
                    the 1942 film Casablanca when Ingrid Bergman delivered the lines: "Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes
                    By.'"
                    It features a distinctive golden yellow hue adorned with an intricate Moroccan pattern in green and
                    gold.

                <h2>The Largest Piano in the World</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1934, Challen introduced two 3.55-meter pianos, with one becoming the world's largest piano in
                    1952.
                    The 2009 "Alexander Piano" measured 5.6 meters, earning the largest grand piano title. In 2010,
                    "Stolëmowi Klawér" became the largest at 6.07 meters long and 1.92 meters high.
                    Finally, the 2019 "Klavins Model 450i Vertical Concert Grand" set the record as the world's largest
                    upright piano at 4.5 meters tall.

                <h2>The Tiniest Grand Piano</h2>
                <p>In 2006, the world's smallest grand piano was successfully created by a tokyo toy manufacturer, Sega
                    Toys.
                    This miniature piano measures just 9.8 inches in width, 7 inches in height and weighs only 2.5
                    kilograms.
                    This intricately designed piano features a small speaker, 88 keys, an SD port, and several
                    pre-recorded songs, allowing it to automatically play pre-set melodies.

                <h2>Pianos can have more than 88 keys</h2>
                <p>Digital pianos have fewer keys and even with traditional pianos, older models may have fewer keys
                    than the standard 88 keys.
                    One of the world's top piano brands, Bosendorfer, produces grand pianos with extra keys as added an
                    additional 92 keys.
                    Then there is a musical instrument company called "Stuart and Sons," which has followed in
                    Bosendorfer's footsteps by manufacturing pianos with 102 and 108 keys.

                <h2>Pianos may have a weight of up to 990 pounds</h2>
                <p>Pianos usually weigh 300-500 pounds, but the largest concert grand pianos can reach 990 pounds.
                    Professional piano movers are needed due to their extreme weight.
                    Factors affecting piano weight include the casing thickness, wood, cast iron plate, strings, legs,
                    lid, hammers, keys, and soundboard.
